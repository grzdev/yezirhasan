Its arrival has opened the door for an unprecedented accomplishment: winning both the NBA Cup and the NBA Championship in the same seasonâ€”a feat now referred to as 'the double.'",

The long-sleeved shirt, the Adidas predator boots, and the jersey number 5 are not mere accessories but symbols of a bygone era, a time when football was played with an artistry that seems almost lost in today's high-octane, physically demanding game.",

Their impressive start comes despite the loss of key players like Marcus Smart and Robert Williams in the offseason. The Celtics' success is due in large part to how quickly the new additions Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have settled into the team.  Porzingis has been a force in the paint, averaging 19.7 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. Holiday has been a leadership presence at point guard, averaging 13.4 points and 5.3 assists per game.",
